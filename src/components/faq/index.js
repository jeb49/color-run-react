                            <p>The course is about 2.5 miles and participants may walk or run the course. As a Fun Run/Walk this is an untimed event and is less about mile times and more about having fun.</p>
                            <p>There will be six color stations throughout the course as well as one water station about halfway through. Some of the stations will also include an optional challenge to complete before moving on.  Of course there will be a water station at the starting/finish line! Port-a-Johns are located at the starting/finish line.</p>
